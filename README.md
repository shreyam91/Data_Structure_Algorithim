## How to Use

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine:

### 2. Choose a Topic

Each folder represents a topic in **Data Structures and Algorithms**. Navigate through the repository and choose a topic to begin your learning journey. For example, to learn about **Arrays**, navigate to the `Arrays` folder:

```bash
cd Arrays
```

Here, you'll find:

- A theoretical explanation of arrays in `README.md`.
- Example code in different programming languages.
- A list of practice problems in `problems.md` to test your knowledge.
- The corresponding solutions in `solutions.md`.

### 3. Start Coding

Pick a programming language and start working on the examples. Once you feel comfortable with the concept, move on to solving the problems.

### 4. Analyze Complexity

Each solution comes with a time and space complexity analysis, helping you understand the performance of the algorithms.

### 5. Take Quizzes (Optional)

If available, take the quizzes at the end of each topic to test your understanding.

### 6. Practice More

After completing the main problems, explore other related problems online, or challenge yourself with more advanced problems.
